# mcp-devsecops-pipeline

_A framework leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enforce DevSecOps best practices in AI-generated code through dynamic testing pipelines._

## Project Vision

**mcp-devsecops-pipeline** is a collaborative, concept-stage initiative focused on integrating the Model Context Protocol (MCP) into AI-driven code generation systems. The goal is to create a framework where LLMs and agentic tools can automatically:

- **Identify and integrate required testing and security tools** (e.g., linters, unit testing frameworks, security scanners).
- **Automatically manage these tools** by downloading, configuring, and executing them as needed.
- **Execute comprehensive testing pipelines** that enforce DevSecOps best practices, ensuring code quality, security, and compliance.

By leveraging MCP, the system aims to enforce rigorous testing standards and secure practices throughout the code generation lifecycle.

## Why Contribute?

This project is in its early, exploratory phase and is open for collaboration from developers, DevOps professionals, security experts, and AI enthusiasts. We invite you to contribute if you are passionate about:

- Enforcing DevSecOps practices within AI-driven code generation.
- Building frameworks that integrate automated testing and security.
- Shaping a standardized approach for LLMs and agentic tools in a secure, compliant development process.

Your input will be crucial in defining the architecture, prototyping key components, and establishing a roadmap for ensuring robust DevSecOps integration.

## CI/CD Pipeline Guide

For an in-depth look at our CI/CD strategies—including pipelines for scripting, compiled, and interpreted languages—please see our [CI/CD Pipeline Stages for Scripting, Compiled, and Interpreted Languages](./CI_CD_PIPELINES.md) and/or [Comprehensive CI/CD Pipeline Testing and Validation Guide](./CI_CD_Validation_Guide.md).

These guide includes detailed stage explanations, Mermaid diagrams, and code examples to help you understand the testing and deployment processes for different types of projects.


## Project Roadmap

Our roadmap outlines key areas for exploration and development:
- **Architecture & Design**: Define how MCP can be used to enforce testing and security best practices.
- **Prototype Module**: Develop an initial proof-of-concept (e.g., for Python code generation and testing pipeline setup).
- **Tool Integration**: Experiment with integrating standard tools (such as `pytest`, `flake8`, and security scanners) using MCP for dynamic configuration.
- **DevSecOps Enforcement**: Create a pipeline that validates generated code against established DevSecOps practices.
- **Cloud & CI/CD Integration**: Explore containerization and cloud deployment for scalable, automated pipelines.
- **Documentation & Community Engagement**: Build comprehensive documentation and foster community collaboration to shape the project’s future.
